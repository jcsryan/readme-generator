 # **DESCRIPTION**
 ## Thesis Statement: A simple README generation application using node and inquirer
 
        
## Project Name: README Generator
## Languages used: JavaScript, ES6, jQuery, Node


## Project Description:
This application lets you create a readme file for any application you are working on quickly and without the need for a repository such as github. It asks questions related to the needed information in the console and generates those answers out onto a MD document. This helps to keep a README up to date, reliable, and eases the burden of making developers think through the questions they need to answer in their projects readme. Simply clone the repo to any project, install node and inquirer and type 'node index.js' to run the prompt lines and generate the page.
